# Perceptron Model Implementation

This project provides a step-by-step guide to building a simple Perceptron model. The model is trained to understand and mimic the behavior of fundamental logical operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.

The purpose of this project is to offer a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the Perceptron model, which is one of the fundamental building blocks in the field of machine learning.

## Key Features

- Basic introduction to binary classification problems.
- A comprehensive guide on the development of the Perceptron model from scratch.
- In-depth explanation of the learning process in the Perceptron model.
- Visual illustrations of the decision boundaries learned by the Perceptron for different logical operations.
- Insight into the limitations of the Perceptron model.

## Installation and Running

This project requires Python 3.7+ and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:


streamlit run app.py
